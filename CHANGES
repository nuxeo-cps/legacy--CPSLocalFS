Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- Updating an old version of this product may not erase the old workflow
  configuration, so make sure that:
  - /cps/sections/.cps_workflow_configuration assigns to the portal type
    "CPSLocalFS" the following workflow: section_folder_wf
  - /cps/workspaces/.cps_workflow_configuration assigns to the portal type
    "CPSLocalFS" the following workflow: workspace_folder_wf
- CPSLocalFS objects previously created will have to be recreated, because
  they may not follow the right workflow.
New features:

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Set permission 'View' instead of 'ModifyPortalContent' on 'isAccessible()'
  method because workspace readers could not have access to a CPSLocalFS
  object in a workspace.
- The installer did not set the right workflow on CPSLocalFS objects set in
  sections.

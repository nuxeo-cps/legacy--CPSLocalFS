1. Untar your CPSLocalFS product in a 'CPSLocalFS' directory of your Zope 
   instance 'Products' directory.

2. CPSLocalFS use the product LocalFS-1.2-andreas (http://www.easyleading.org/
   Downloads/view), therefore you need to untar it in the 'Products/LocalFS' 
   folder of your Zope instance. 

i3. Only pre-authorized paths can be accessed by CPSLocalFS users. Administra
   -tors allow access to some folders by adding their paths to the
   'localfs_dirs.txt' which must be added to the CLIENT_HOME folder of
   your Zope instance.
   Eg: '/tmp/sharedcontent/' will allow CPSLocalFS to access the content of 
   'sharedcontent' and its subfolders.

4. Install CPSLocalFS, do so by running its install script. For instance, from
   the ZMI, add an External Method to your CPS site with the following 
   parameters:

       - id : CPSLocalFS Installer (or whatever)
       - title: CPSLocalFS Installer (or whatever)
       - Module Name: CPSLocalFS.install
       - Funciton Name: install

   Press save and run it by clicking on the 'test' tab of this external method.
   Note that CPSLocalFS can't be installed under windows.
   
5. Make sure CPSLocalFS is working by running 'make' in its 'tests'
   folder. 

6. You are all set.

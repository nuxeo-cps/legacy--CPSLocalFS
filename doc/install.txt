1. CPSLocalFS use the product LocalFS-1.2-andreas (http://www.easyleading.org/
   Downloads/view), therefore you need to untar it in the 'Products' folder 
   of your Zope instance. 

2. Only pre-authorized paths can be accessed by CPSLocalFS users. Administra
   -tors allow access to some folders by adding their paths to the
   localfs_dirs.txt which must be added to the ZOPE_HOME/var folder of your 
   Zope instance.
   Eg: '/tmp/sharedcontent' will allow CPSLocalFS to access the content of 
   'sharedcontent' and its subfolders.

3. Install CPSLocalFS, do so by running its install script. For instance, from
   the ZMI, add an External Method to your CPS site with the following parameters:

       - id : CPSLocalFS Installer (or whatever)
       - title: CPSLocalFS Installer (or whatever)
       - Module Name: CPSLocalFS.install
       - Funciton Name: install

   Press save and run it by clicking on the 'test' tab of this external method.

4. You are all set.

# This file is intended to be placed in your Zope instance
# ZOPE_HOME/var folder. It features a list of the files you
# want to allow access through CPSLocalFS.
# The Zope process needs to have read and write access on
# those files. Hence, if a file does not have sufficients
# access rights, LocalFS will forbid its access to your users. 
# To avoid things to turn hurry for your users, best practice
# would be not to leave any file with unsufficients rights 
# in those folders.
#
# Any line starting with a '#' is commented out.
# 
# WARNING : Removing a path from this list does not remove
# previous CPSLocalFS instancied with this path.
